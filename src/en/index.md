Hi, my name is Tatiana Fokina, or just Tanya for short. Who am I? I am a web accessibility specialist and enthusiast who likes developing user-friendly interfaces and discussing digital accessibility with others (sometimes in the middle of the night).

In this blog, I share practical tips and hacks, useful links, my thoughts, and interesting findings about accessible code, design, and much more âœ¨

If you have any questions about my articles or accessibility, feel free to ask me on [LinkedIn]({{ links.social.linkedin }}) and [Twitter]({{ links.social.twitter }}).
